            <p>The term soft skills was created by the U.S. Army in the late 1960's. It refers to any skill that does
                not employ the use of machinery. The military realized that many important activities were included
                within this category, and in fact, the social skills necessary to lead groups, motivate soldiers, and
                win wars were encompassed by skills they had not yet catalogued or fully studied. Since 1959, the U.S.
                Army has been investing a considerable amount of resources into technology-based development of training
                procedures. In 1968 the U.S. Army officially introduced a training doctrine known as "Systems
                Engineering of Training" covered in the document CON Reg 350-100-1</p>

            <p>Soft skills are a cluster of productive personality traits that characterize one's relationships in a
                social environment. These skills can include social graces, communication abilities, language skills,
                personal habits, cognitive or emotional empathy, time management, teamwork and leadership traits. A
                definition based on review literature explains soft skills as an umbrella term for skills under three
                key functional elements: people skills, social skills, and personal career attributes.[12]

                The importance of soft skills lies in the fact that they are not restricted to a specific field. These
                thinking dispositions consist of a group of abilities that can be used in every aspect of people’s
                lives, without any need to readapt them based on the situation. Their ductility helps “people to adapt
                and behave positively so that they can deal effectively with the challenges of their professional and
                everyday life”.[13] Soft skills make people flexible in a world which keeps changing</p>
            <p>Interest in soft skills have increased over the years. The more research that is conducted, the more
                people understand the relevance of this concept. The huge amount of fund companies and worldwide
                organizations are investing in the training and development of this field shows this interest. The
                European Commission launched the program Agenda for new skills and jobs in 2012 in order to train and
                explain to young adults this new set of skills</p>

            <p>“Hard skills include technical or administrative competence”.[16] Soft skills are commonly used to “refer
                to the “emotional side” of human beings in opposition to the IQ (Intelligent Quotient) component related
                to hard skills”.[13] Hard and soft skills are usually defined as similar concepts or complements. This
                fact demonstrates how these two different types of abilities are strictly related.</p>

               <p> Hard skills were the only skills necessary for career employment and were generally quantifiable and
                measurable from an educational background, work experience or through interview. Success at work seemed
                to be related solely to the technical ability of completing tasks. For this reason, employer and
                companies used to hire new people based only on their objective competencies. This clarifies why
                nowadays people with good soft skills are in such shorter supply than workers with good hard skills.</p>

                <p>The trend has changed in the last years. Hard skills still represent a fundamental aspect, but soft
                skills equaled them for importance. According to the leadership professor Robert Lavasseur, most of the
                researchers he interviewed in this field “rated soft skills higher than technical skills”.[16] Studies
                by Stanford Research Institute and the Carnegie Mellon Foundation among Fortune 500 CEOs confirm this
                idea establishing that 75% of long term job success resulted from soft skills and only 25% from
                technical skills (Sinha, 2008). Another study found that 80% of achievements in career are determined by
                soft skills and only 20% by hard skills</p>

            <p>Because of their rising importance, the need to teach soft skills has become a major concern for
                educators and employers all over the world.[21][22] Because soft skills are poorly defined, teaching
                them is more challenging, compared to classical skills. For this reason, the first step consists of
                understanding how to evaluate them, so that educators can track student progress.</p>

               <p> As for teaching, evaluating soft skills is harder than technical skills. “Quizzes or exams cannot
                accurately measure interpersonal and leadership skills”.[23] Group projects seem to be a good way to
                develop soft skills, but evaluating them still represent a hard obstacle. Researchers consider peer
                evaluation a good compromise between working in groups and an objective evaluation. The researches
                conducted on this topic reported both positive and negative results.[23] The study carried out by
                professor Zhang of Georgia Southern University, although with few participants, “is an initial step in
                designing and validating a peer assessment scale”.</p>

                <p>“The development of soft skills is much more difficult than the development of hard skills because it
                requires actively interacting with others on an ongoing basis and being willing to accept behavioral
                feedback”.[16] While hard skills can be learned studying from a book or from individual training, soft
                skills needs a combination of environment and other people to be mastered. For this reason, learning
                doesn’t depend solely on the person, but it is influenced by different factors that make the education
                harder and unpredictable.</p>

            <p>According to the OECD's Skills Outlook 2019 report, life-long learning or metacognition, is becoming more
                necessary for employment and for handling a future environment of increased uncertainty. The report
                states, ‘humans are likely to be able to handle uncertainty better than AI,’ as the latter is able to
                complete specific tasks efficiently and can respond effectively to some characteristics of uncertainty
                and complexity. However, if the context of the task and goals are ambiguous or mutable, the program
                often experiences a ‘breakdown’. In contrast, humans can respond more readily to uncertainty,</p>
                <p>volatility, complexity, and ambiguity ,through being adaptable learners and being able to readily adopt,
                develop, and discard their beliefs and their understanding of the world, when given a new context (OECD,
                2019[34]). Notwithstanding this, humans sometimes fail to do so productively and machines, in many
                cases, lack those capacities entirely (Laukkonen, Biddell and Gallagher, 2018[35]).</p>

                <p>The National Business Education Association deems soft skills as critical for being industrious in
                today’s workplace.[36] For this reason, soft skills are increasingly sought out by employers in addition
                to standard qualifications. A shortage of soft skills makes people who have them incredibly valuable and
                desired to companies.</p>
